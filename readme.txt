Olegmods.INC presents... another Factory, created based on old factory concepts from 2019. After the release of the official version, many models were replaced by the HotA release ones, except for Juggernauts, Dreadnoughts, Thieves, Bandits, Rainbow and Crimson Couatls and the old variation of Automatons, which I renamed to Termotrons.
Since October 13, 2023, Mechanics and Engineers have appeared in the Factory, their skill has been added, authored by the author of the port of the official Factory to VCMI Ben Yan.
This mod has alternative creatures (Termotrons and Automatons), as well as 2 tier 7s: Couatls and Dreadnoughts. You can also build 2 tier 2 dwellings that have a common growth: Mechanics and Rogues. Also there is a third upgrade of Gunslinger.
Note that this Factory differs in many ways from the original, many features of which are not implemented in VCMI. But this city also has many of its own advantages. For example, an alternative unit and 2 units (level 2 and 7), which can be built in one city.
Enjoy the game!
